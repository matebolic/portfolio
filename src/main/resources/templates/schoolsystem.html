                <p>Flow Work Earth - project phase 2.
                    School System
                    Your task is to build a school registration system.
                    Recommended classes: Name, Subject, Grade, Student, Teacher, ClassDiary</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>create queryable data in a JSON file</li>
                    <li>when starting the program, decide what we want to do
                        a - entering a grade in the diary
                        b - student search/query (displayed on the console)
                        i. basic info query
                        ii. grade point average (can also be requested broken down by subject)
                        c - class search/query (displayed on console)
                        i. basic info query
                        ii. grade point average (can also be requested broken down by subject)</li>
                    <li>admission of new students, recording of data</li>
                    <li>Absences can be recorded, this should also be entered in the diary with the student&#39;s name
                        and reason</li>
                    <li>(optional) expand the relationship between teachers and subjects, it can be 1-to-many
                        relationship (one
                        a teacher can belong to several subjects and vice versa)
                        In addition to these, you can create extended functionalities as you like!</li>
                </ol>

                <ul>
                    <li>CRUD operations in the meaning of a school system: creating/modifying/deleting/archiving users
                    </li>
                    <li>different menus due to login based on the user&#39;s type: student, teacher, admin</li>
                    <li>teachers can registrate student class diaries (absent students and the reason of absence)</li>
                    <li>teachers can registrate marks to different subjects (available actually 10 different subject
                        defined as enums)</li>
                    <li>all data - marks, absenses - is available for students or classes too</li>
                    <li>possible to treat classes and students as archived: in this case their data are saved to
                        different json-files and handled by this way in the future</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In this project phase one of the most important skills was to order the different features by
                    importance, because there was only 2 weeks for it. It was also beneficial for practicing time
                    management as well. The solid fundementals of using JSON-s was one of the biggest technical
                    challenge due to the numerous classes. After the first project phase (where I made a minesweeper
                    application with 2 of my classmates together) this time I put the emphasize on to create clean code
                    too.</p>
                <h3 id="continued-development">Continued development</h3>
                <p>The application was made during the course, where the used language was hungarian, for this reason I
                    wanted to modify the program to be used as a bilingual application: therefore I have to translate
                    its menus and add a langauge choice option. It would be also very useful the develop and design the
                    application&#39;s UI to be able to used from a web-environment.</p>
